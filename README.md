### Why do we need a forest fire prediction model?

Forest department experts can check on 3-4 parameters from their human mind but ML on other hand can handle the numerous parameters whether it can be latitude, longitude, satellite, version, and whatnot, so dealing with this multi-relationship of a parameter that is responsible for the fire in the forest we do need ML for sure!
