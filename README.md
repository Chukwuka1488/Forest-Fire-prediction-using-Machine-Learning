# Forest-Fire-prediction-using-Machine-Learning

### Why do we need a forest fire prediction model?

Forest department experts can check on 3-4 parameters from their human mind but ML on other hand can handle the numerous parameters whether it can be latitude, longitude, satellite, version, and whatnot, so dealing with this multi-relationship of a parameter that is responsible for the fire in the forest we do need ML for sure!

### Note: 
By the way from the dataset we are not finding if the forest fire happens or not, we are trying to find the confidence of the forest fire happening. They may seem to be the same thing but there is a very small difference between them, try to find that ðŸ™‚
